# Huffman-coding-algorithm

When the code is run, two options will be available, compress and decompress. 
You can only compress a text file and it must not have newlines because currently, our code cannot handle newlines. 
Compressing a file is straight forward.
It will create a compressed bin file and a text file for the key. 
For decompressing a bin file, you go to the decompress section. 
There first you have to select the bin file and then the key file and then press decompress. 
It will create a text file.
